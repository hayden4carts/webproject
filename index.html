<h2>Who Is Stephen King?</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King">Stephen King</a> is an 
American novelist and short-story writer whose books are credited with reviving
 the horror fiction genre in the late 20th century. He is referred to as the 
"King of Horror," and his appeal even branches to audiences who do not enjoy
 frightening movies-- while many movie adaptations of his novels are wildly 
popular, his books exist as a milder, fantastic, and beautifully crafted
 testament to his skill as a writer.</p>

<h2>Which Book Should I Read First?</h2>

<p>While there are a series of popular starting points in King's library of 
	text works, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(novel)">
	"The Shining"</a> is a popular starting place; its immortalization in 
Kubrick-directed cinema has landed it on a definitive list of classics, but 
the skill of writing, interest of story, and milder themes within this horror 
novel color it as an ideal beginning place for those who enjoy a well-balanced,
 easy-to-read story and wish to veer into the world of literary mystery and 
horror.</p>
